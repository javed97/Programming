There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing.
In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first, then the <div> element's click event.
In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <div> element's click event will be handled first, then the <p> element's click event.
The default value is false, which will use the bubbling propagation, when the value is set to true, the event uses the capturing propagation.
